Overview of the analysis:

1. The purpose is well defined - 
  - Idea behind this html web page is to provide user more options to get relevant data. 
  - Users can input the text which will give them required data by filtering the datasets. 
  - We used javascript files and html file which connect with each other and provide the required output. 

2. Results:

Description of how to perform a search, with images. 
  - Search can be performed with very simple way. 
  - Webpage is opened which will provide the table with various data. 
  - you have to choose which particular data you want to filter or want to see. 
  - You can use different options for e.g. either by city or by country or by date etc. 
  - then the webpage will provide that data.

3. Summary - As a learner this webpage is good to understand the Javascript. 
    - Drawback - However, from user point of view this webpage is static. As information is constant not updating. also there needs to be more informaiton or buttons to help user to ask for inputing data. 

    - Two recommendations - 
          1.  There should be buttons which allows the user to get required data. Also option to download or save that data on user desktop. 
          2.  There should be some kind of instructions which user will follow to get required data. 
  
  Overall this is the webpage which will help users to filter the data as required.
